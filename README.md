# Brane Project Explainer

Brane is an experimental project that aims to build secure, convenient third-party app environment based on web technologies.

Brane's idea loosely follows the [Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) and [MiniApp Standardization White Paper](https://www.w3.org/TR/mini-app-white-paper/)
